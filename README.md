# DeepModels
A couple deep learning models for reference and an auto differentiation program.

a2c: Synchronous actor critic RL network

adiff: simple auto differentiation

cnn: simple convolutional network

gan: Generative adverserial network

np_1layer_batchdecent: Manually build network (numpy math operations) of one layer using minibatch gradient descent.

rnn: Simple recurrent neural network
