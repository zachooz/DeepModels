# DeepModels
Deep learning models for reference and an auto differentiation program.

a2c: Synchronous actor critic RL network used on the cartpole problem

adiff: simple auto differentiation

cnn: simple convolutional network used on mnist

gan: Generative adverserial network built to generate faces

np_1layer_batchdecent: Manually built network (numpy math operations) of one layer using minibatch gradient descent.

rnn: Simple recurrent neural network build to predict the next word
